        <h2>What are VCS?</h2>
        <p>VCS is a tool-software meant to track the changes - as commits, in the code - as a repository, in intent to make it easier for bigger teams to work on a single codebase.</p>
        <p>Oldest VCS can be dated back to 70' and changed much from their original form, mostly thanks to the internet. More about history on dedicated page.</p>
        <p>So what are the abbilities of this tools? They allow for easier distribution of code to multiple devices, thus making the sharing code easier and allowing for multiple people to work independently (on branches) on the same files, without unnecesary risks.</p>
        <p>Not only that but since all changes are tracked, they can be (usually) reverted or checked-out at any time, as long as repository is intact.</p>
        <p>Modern VCS software like git, also make it harder to accidentally delete all code, since all devs have their own copy of whole repository.</p>
        <p>Their copies can be uploaded/ fetched to central server keeping everyone up to date and allowing them to work from pretty much anywhere.</p>
        <p>It's a vital tool no matter if working alone or in a team, even if it's just for the backup in the cloud.</p>
