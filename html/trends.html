        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>GitOps</h2>
                <p>Is a practice of using git to control everything. It gives a lot of control and allows for easy restoration/rollback if soemthing goes wrong, as well as keeping track of chanegs made to configuration files.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Cloud based collaboration</h2>
                <p>Uses one of the platforms like GitHub, GitLab etc. to collaborate on codebase on a company-wide scale. Not only git features are used, but additional features of platforms like issues and pull/merge requests which make working in a team much easier than using pure git or any other VCS. The procedure can vary depending of inner policies in a company.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>AI assisted code reviews</h2>
                <p>AI is used to help with VCS, in cases like merge conflicts and help to detect errors/ issues on if it has access to repository as context. This approach arguments and automates some part of the work.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Development pipeline</h1>
        <p>In summary real-life use case for VCS nowaday may look like this:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Creating a branch for specific case/ issue</li>
            <li>Editing code on local repository copy</li>
            <li>Making a pull request for the changes</li>
            <li>Automated and manual code testing and review</li>
            <li>
                Either:
                <ol>
                    <li>Pull request is not accepted and it's back to step 2</li>
                    <li>Pull request is accepted and merged into main branch</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Changes are automatically deployed</li>
            <li>If needed changes can be reverted</li>
        </ol>
