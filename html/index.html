                <h2>What are VCS?</h2>
                <p>VCS are pieces of software designed to track changes and allow for easier code manipulation and editing code by multiple people at a time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Features</h2>
                <p>Main part of VCS is a repository which stores information about the changes from it's initialisation. Once repository is set up, changes to code can be registered by commiting, saving current 'snapshot' of files in repository with description. Commits are organised into branches, where main (or master) is de-facto version, while any other additional branches are it's pallarel versions. Branches can be merged, trying to apply commited changes from both of the branches.</p>
                <p>Repository itself can be stored locally, on a server or 'peer-to-peer'-like network. It can be easily cloned (copied) and updated by pulling or pushing changes. </p>
